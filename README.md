# Build-In-OpenSource

## 1. Introduction

Let's build an application which can facilitate the buy, sale new and old products. Where seller can post products and advertise it for sale and buyer can navigate through the products view product as per choice and buy it online.
Application will have the feature to search products, view product details, add to cart, view order history,manage profile , chat with the seller directly without any mediator buy product by paying the price. Payment system will collect the money of the product and certain % percentage of the money will be deducted as a commission and rest of the money will be transferred to the seller account after the product is delivered to the buyer.
Buyer can rate the experience of buying the product, seller and delivery etc. The communication of every process will be done through the email and SMS.

A complete production-level project of NodeJS Microservice with Serverless technology. Through this I will build and deploying an enterprise-level application .I will get a good understanding of going from scratch to production using AWS infrastructure using infrastructure as code.
